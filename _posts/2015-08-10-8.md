I *love* reading. Surprisingly enough, that was not always the case. During school years, I hated reading and I did find it quite boring. Interestingly, in the last 7 years or so since I started reading books, I find it more satisfactory than ever. Lately my curious personality has led me into a path of indecisiveness with regards to my reading habits.

Previously I was disciplined enough to read 1 book at a time but now with the all the technical knowledge that exists within the programming realm, I find myself battling between several books. I always believed that reading multiple books at the same time is a bad idea but after reading [this](http://rachelannhanley.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/the-art-of-reading-multiple-books-vs.html) post I'm intrigued to give it a go. I can resonate with many of the points the author makes which makes me confident about the outcome.

My concurrent ambitious list includes the following:

- [JavaScript Allonge](https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix/read#leanpub-auto-prelude-values-and-expressions-over-coffee)
- [Computer Science: A Modern Introduction](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Computer-Science-Introduction-Prentice-International/dp/0131659456/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1439152819&sr=8-1&keywords=modern+computer+science)
- [Tangled Web](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tangled-Web-Securing-Modern-Applications/dp/1593273886/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1439152883&sr=8-1&keywords=tangled+web)
