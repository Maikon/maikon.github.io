> _The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he means._

>_&mdash;Mortimer Adler_

Richard Feynman, like Adler, knew that there's a difference between
knowing something by name and knowing something. When asked by a fellow
scientist to explain a complex theory, his response was _"I'll prepare a
freshman lecture on it."_ A few days later he told that scientist that he
couldn't do it—that he couldn't reduce it enough to the point that he
could teach it to a beginner. Speaking of the subject, he concluded _"That
means we don't really understand it."_.

Feynman understood better than anyone the value of teaching, and developed
his
[own technique](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2012/04/learn-anything-faster-with-the-feynman-technique/),
which helped him gain a deep understanding in an area of interest.

We work in an industry where we have names and jargon for all sorts of
things. In some cases we have multiple names for the same
thing. Shallow learning (_knowing things by name_) is far more common than
deep learning (_knowing things_).

At 8th Light continuous learning is an ongoing process. It's a process that
involves both shallow and deep learning, and we constantly look at ways to
pursue and practice both. Teaching is one of the foundations of this process.

## Zagaku

One thing we started doing at the London office that has proven successful
is [Zagaku](http://www.japandict.com/座学). Every morning a
crafter or an apprentice will teach a topic for 20-30 minutes to the
apprentices. This approach has several benefits:

- Learning happens on both ends (crafter & apprentices)
- Apprentices get to learn about fundamentals and/or things they do not
  understand clearly
- It provides a safe environment to ask any questions
- Teaching provides a platform through which to gain deeper knowledge
- Apprentices provide the content for the next sessions with their questions

## The Debating Society

Another thing we attempted was The Debating Society, which ran for a
while. The idea was based on the standard debating society model. A topic
would be chosen and then two people would debate over it—one making the
case for, one making the case against.

A topic at the time was _"Optional Typing in Ruby is Bad"_. We would
normally have the person who was in favor of this idea arguing against it.
The goal was to push that person to explore the alternative, the
thing they didn't like much, and in the process gain a new perspective.

Despite the fact that some interesting discussions resulted from such
debates, often we struggled to find topics that would be suitable for such
a debate and were also interesting enough for people to engage in. A lot of
them were fairly generic, which made focusing on learning and understanding
a specific topic difficult.

## Book Club

On a couple of occasions we also attempted to establish a regular book club
using different variations (must-read papers, books etc). We tied
this back into teaching by having the participants take turns presenting
the ideas of each chapter as the group progressed through the book.

A book we worked through was
["Seven Databases in Seven Weeks"](https://pragprog.com/book/rwdata/seven-databases-in-seven-weeks). Our
goal was to essentially scratch the surface and expose ourselves
to some of those databases from a high level. The objective was _"understand
it enough to be able to explain the basic principles"_.

The initial excitement and commitment faded away fairly quickly
though, partly because people tend to process information at different
speeds and in different ways. This meant that one person (usually the
person who suggested the book) would end up doing most of the chapters—and
though that worked for one person, it didn't scale well with a group.
There might be a formula that works for a book club, but we haven't found
that just yet.

## 8th Light University

Another ongoing initiative that has worked for us is 8th Light University,
which encompasses a variety of things. This takes place every Friday, and
involves some or all of the following:

- Talks
- Performing katas
- Workshops

The above can be seen as different arenas for teaching where a crafter or an
apprentice can step into and perform something they spent a good
amount of time learning. Unlike the ancient Roman arenas, these provide a safe
environment for people to explore and demonstrate their knowledge. Feedback
is always provided after a performance, and stepping into that arena is
already considered a success.

Something we often found helpful in this process is providing a
crafter or an apprentice a topic they can work on. Most people,
including myself, struggle when it comes to finding an interesting
topic to talk about, and doing it this way helps solve that problem.

## Apprenticeship

Teaching is constantly present within 8th Light, but never more so than in
the apprenticeship.

In his seminal work ["No Silver Bullet"](http://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks-NoSilverBullet.pdf), Fred Brooks says that one of
the key actions one can take to tackle the complexity ingrained within
software is _"identifying and developing the great conceptual designers of
the rising generation"_. He then goes on to describe what is essentially an
apprenticeship and the importance it plays towards the above goal.

An apprenticeship is not a one-way road, though—the apprentice is not the
only one who benefits. The mentor also benefits greatly through teaching.
An apprentice will often help illuminate the blind spots and gaps in the
mentor's knowledge by asking questions that she or he might not be able to
answer clearly. These are opportunities for the mentor to improve and learn.

We emphasize the importance of this and encourage our apprentices to seek
the same opportunities when teaching others. They also get to be mentors
and teachers by going to events that are attended by people learning how
to program, such as [codebar](https://codebar.io).

> _I teach. What's your superpower?_

Being able to teach something in a simple and clear manner indicates
deep knowledge. Not only can it help you reach a deeper understanding on a
topic, but it also enables you to improve the people you work with and the
community you belong to.
