Fear is paralyzing. It's the thing that holds us back most of the time and stops us from moving forward. It stops us from making progress. We face Fear daily when we ask ourselves "Is this the right thing to do?".

Ultimately in every decision we take there will be a tradeoff. I fear standing in front of an audience to give a talk but if I do, I gain many things. I fear exposing my ignorance and weaknesses but by doing so, I allow others to offer me advice as to how I can be better.

Fear is paralyzing. Fear is also temporary. Beyond the realm of Fear lies our best self.

In the words of Marianne Williamson:

> *"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure."*
