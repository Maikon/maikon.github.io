Ruby resources for Practise

Due to time constraints or rather bad time management from my part, I didn't get a chance to write a post on a specific subject. Nevertheless I'll share some Ruby resources that come handy when practising different things in the language.

Here are a few:

- [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/)
- [Coder Sumo](http://codersumo.com/)
- [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/)
- [Ruby Monk](https://rubymonk.com/)
- [Codequizzes (general not just Ruby)](http://www.codequizzes.com/)

I shall be more punctual next time...
