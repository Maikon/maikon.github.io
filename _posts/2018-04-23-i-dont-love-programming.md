I **love** what it **enables** me to do.

You don't need to love programming to be good at it. You may love any of
the following way more than programming:

  - Traveling
  - Spending time with friends and family
  - Learning \<enter skill\>
  - Practicing or perfecting \<enter skill\>

What do all of the above have in common? **Time**.

Time is the most valuable commodity we have as people. It is something we can never get back.

I like traveling. I like spending time with my friends and family. I
like watching FC Barcelona play. I also like "wasting"[^1] time on Netflix.

An example of a wasteful activity within programming is performing a repetitive task manually.
A good example is search and replace. You can go manually find and
replace N number of occurrences you want to change _or_ you can learn your editor's shortcut
to do this instantly. This type of action might not seem beneficial in
that moment in time but when added up over a long period of time, the
compound effect results in big time savings.

You can apply this approach to many aspects. Whether its learning shortcuts
for your editor or UNIX, the inner workings of
Python or any other tool, the principle is the same.

You don't have to love programming to learn your tools better. You don't
have to be a geek. You don't even need to learn a bunch of tools or new
technologies. Just the tools you use the most on a daily basis. Your time is invaluable.

I don't love programming. I love the time it buys me for the things that
matter the most. I'm sure you do too.
