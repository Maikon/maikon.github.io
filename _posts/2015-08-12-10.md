Practice makes perfect they say. Deliberate, constant practice leads to a change. A big change one might say since that new thing that you have just acquired was not present before. The great Aristotle knew this when he famously said: "We are what we repeatedly do; Excellence then is not an act but a habit.". Poignant and true.

Fittingly, this also the point of this exercise. Improving or acquiring the wonderful skill of writing. Rigorously applying these rules in these blog posts, provides our mind and fingers with more ideas and options when writing a more meaningful and longer post or even a book. Keep writing, keep exploring.
