Nearly 2 months ago I was finishing my [journey](http://shokunin.roon.io) at Makers Academy. Couple of weeks prior to that day though, I was present when Paul Pagel the CEO of [8th Light](http://8thlight.com) came to MA to give us a talk about Software Craftsmanship.

Before listening to the talk, my biggest concern as I was approaching graduation day and getting ready to start the hunt for work, was finding a company that would have certain values/characteristics that I valued more than others. Honesty, curiosity, taking responsibility and above all, a passion and desire to constantly try and be better than yesterday. Whether that's learning a new language, improving a piece of code over and over again, cleaning up a messy test suite, I needed to be in an environment where "it's good enough", would not be accepted as a job well done.

Fast forward to today and I'm honoured to say that I'm part of such a company. Today I officially started my apprenticeship with 8th Light. After Paul's talk that day and an extended discussion with Enrique, my teacher at MA, I was convinced that 8th Light was the place to be. In attendance that day was also Jim who is now my mentor.

I already learned a lot just by going through the lengthy interview process with Jim. Completing my technical challenge and implementing an unbeatable AI using a recursive algorithm, being the highlight. I will follow up on the latter soon with a longer post trying to deconstruct and analyse that specific algorithm.

I've been given already few tasks for this week which include going through the first few chapters of Sandi Metz's [POODR](http://www.sandimetz.com/poodr/) and re-doing TicTacToe while following and implementing good principles.

It's only the beginning but this journey already feels promising and exciting. Can't wait for day 2.
