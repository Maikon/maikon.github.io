It is often said that the best way to learn something is by trying to teach it to someone else. This statement forms part of the reason why 8th Light believes very strongly in the idea of the apprenticeship.

Knowledge is passed through the craftspeople down to the apprentices. In doing so the craftspeople reinforce what they already know while also understanding what they don't. Whenever I'm trying to teach something I think I know to someone else and can't do a good job, I see it as an opportunity to improve and grow.

This process however is not easy. It's not easy because an apprentice looks up to you for knowledge and wisdom even when you might not possess either in the scenario she presents to you. That's where courage and wisdom lie though. In the ability to admit your lack of knowledge and lack of experience. In the ability to explore those areas whilst still helping someone else improve.

It takes courage and courage is something craftspeople should never be short of.
