Today we started the day with a talk/mini exercise with Paul Pagel, our CEO who is in town visiting. The exercise required each person to take a piece of paper and write down an article that would be written in 5 years time about 8th Light by someone on some platform. The goal was to drive out the vision that each of us had for 8th Light going forward.

I wrote about how 8th Light's culture would be discussed and how it can be used as a tool of change. 8th Light's culture is one of its biggest assets. There were many other interesting ideas and views and it was really great seeing how each of us saw 8th Light growing and to which direction.

The common vision that we all share though is the belief that software should be and can be done better. It is a vision that unites us and drives us forward.
