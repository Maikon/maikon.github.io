Every Friday at 8th Light we only work half of the day whilst the rest of it is free for us to work on anything that improves our craft, whether that is picking up a new language, learning new tools or working on open source projects.

I have been experimenting with the Elixir language for quite a while now and one of the best ways to explore a language is by using katas. Katas are exercises that are focused usually on small problems that can be solved in a relatively short amount of time and are a great tool to use when learning a new language. An interesting kata is the [Gilded Rose](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) kata which is more focused on the idea of working with legacy code and how you can improve that piece of code.

Since I've been experimenting with Elixir, I decided to implement the kata in Elixir so that anyone who wants to practice in Elixir can do so. The kata can be found [here](https://github.com/Maikon/gilded_rose_elixir).
