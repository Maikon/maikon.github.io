It's hard to tell what my favourite food is. I don't even think I have a "favourite" food. Instead I would say I have a _list_ of favourite foods. A good steak is definitely on that list.

After work I went to a restaurant called _"Flat Iron"_. The first thing that struck me was that on their menu they only had __one__ main; steak. It was even highlighted inside a big box outline. I've only seen this in another restaurant, choosing to offer one option only as a main course. This usually means that the one thing they do, they do well and this was no different.

I ordered mine medium rare and it was delivered on a very nice wooden board. The meat was very tender and delicious. I also ordered their version of "Old Fashioned" which contained blood orange oil. Outstanding. The best part of all this though? 10 pounds for an awesome steak.
