One of my tasks for this week is to perform and record the Roman Numerals Kata in under 10min. I stopped recording as soon as I reached the algorithm since beyond that point I was simply typing in the rest of the cases.

The kata can be shown below and I have also put below the link to the Github repository if you want to see the full code with the commit history showing each step:
