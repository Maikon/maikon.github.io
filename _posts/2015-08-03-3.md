Dish washing, unlike many things, is a very relaxing process.
A long time ago I read a book on [Mindfulness](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Miracle-Mindfulness-Classic-Meditation-Revered/dp/1846041066/ref=sr_1_22?ie=UTF8&qid=1438623001&sr=8-22&keywords=mindfulness). In the book the great buddhist monk described
how wonderful the process of dish washing can be. With time and patience you slowly remove
every stain, whilst being in the moment. And here lies the key to this process; being in the moment.
With dish washing, distractions are minimal; you have to focus on getting the stains off.
In those moments your mind is no longer wandering in other places like it usually does.
It's there and it's taking a break from the speed forces that surround your day. This is why I always
prefer doing the dishes manually instead of using a dish washing machine.
It allows me to slow down, it allows me to stop and both of these are essential to happiness.
