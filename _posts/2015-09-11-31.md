Today I attended a workshop on Cryptography. Joe Armstrong, the co-creator of Erlang was did a very good job explaining the various techniques used in cryptography, both common and not so common. It was intended more as a primer with a bit more substance and it was just enough to make want to learn more.

Joe made a very good point during the workshop. One of the things that you will hear often about Cryptography is that you should never do it yourself and learn the experts take care of it. This in turn creates a situation where there's a small group of experts and a large number of people that don't really understand cryptography and nothing in between. The problem however comes from the fact that most people that write applications that deal with sensitive data, tend to fall in the last category of the above two.

With yet [another reminder](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/09/once-seen-as-bulletproof-11-million-ashley-madison-passwords-already-cracked/) of how important it is to understand, at least the fundamentals of cryptography, I will be doing further exploration on the subject. I definitely got enough from the workshop to continue from there.
