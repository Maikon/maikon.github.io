When learning a new skill it is important that one spends time understanding the fundamentals of that skill but equally important, if not more, is the ability to detach oneself from any previous experiences that could hinder the process of acquiring that new skill.

In programming for example where many paradigms exist, including but not limited to Objected-Oriented and Functional, one must be able to forego any previous experience in other paradigms if she/he is to grasp a new one which is often the most common problem that people, including myself, have when trying to tackle such a subject.
