Today's post will be very short. Short as in a few links which I went through and are related to testing. I will be revisiting them frequently as I always pick up new things from articles like these.

- [Test Isolation is about Avoiding Mocks](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/blog/2014/test-isolation-is-about-avoiding-mocks)
- [Avoid Testing Implementation Details, Test Behaviours](http://codebetter.com/iancooper/2011/10/06/avoid-testing-implementation-details-test-behaviours/)
- [Mocks Aren't Stubs](http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html)
