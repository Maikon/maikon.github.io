The Repositor asked "Are you there Booking?". The Booking was nowhere to be found. The params came flying in and screaming; "Order number is here!". Still no sound. Silence. Mystery everywhere. Everybody is looking for the Booking. The one and only Booking. The ultimate Booking. Long nights, long requests. Lagging. Puzzled customers; they also are looking for the Booking. The Booking is still missing. Growing fear. The Booking might have gone forever. In it's place the fearsome & loathsome Nil. What is Nil? The Repositor does not know. The customers don't know. No one knows. Will the Booking ever come back...?
