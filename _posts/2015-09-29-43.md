For a variety of reasons, functional programming is staging a comeback. For one, the rise of languages like Clojure and the wave of fame Erlang is riding with it's [Whatsapp success](http://www.wired.com/2015/09/whatsapp-serves-900-million-users-50-engineers/), it is not a surprise people are looking for more on information on the subject.

In an industry where [Object-Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) has ruled for many years, this sort of feels like a revolution, especially if you consider that many functional languages were invented a long time ago (Lisp - 1958, Erlang - 1986 etc). As a result, more and more programmers are looking into this not-so-new paradigm.

A common problem occurs though which is not so much a programmer-specific problem but rather a problem most people would face. Unlearning old habits.

The above seems to be a big barrier for many people but it is a barrier that [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) seems to have made more easy to jump. Doning a [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29) like syntax, it entices more and more people into it's realm. Once one is in it, he/she quickly realizes that though it looks like Ruby, it's nothing like Ruby. Everything is immutable. No assignment. Pattern Matching. Recursion over iteration. Dig a bit deeper and you find the fearsome [Octopus](http://makisotman.com/100_words_challenge/100/2015/09/07/27.html) that lies beneath; Erlang.

Elixir is also an attractive name. A potion, intended or not, it seems to also act as the gateway drug of non-functional people...
