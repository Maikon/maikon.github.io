I've done several jobs throughout my life. All of them had something to teach me. I benefited from every one of them, even from the ones I disliked. Those jobs stopped being beneficial to me when the learning ended. When there was nothing more that a job could teach me or at least it was not challenging enough on a consistent basis.

By entering the software world, the pendulum swung on the other side. Now I'm being challenged daily to improve and become better. Joining a company who values the idea of continuous self-improvement while it helps, it also adds more responsibilities on your shoulder. On some days that can be tiring.

What makes it worth it is seeing the impact your actions have and the connections you make with people that you respect and share common values with. It's a valuable journey and the limitless aura that surrounds it, makes it a very fulfilling experience.
