Unsurprisingly enough I love quotes. I say unsurprisingly because people that know me well and beyond the level of "acquaintance", will tell you how often I refer to quotes. Aristotle's [various](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1003359-we-are-what-we-repeatedly-do-excellence-then-is-not) [quotes](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/46700-to-avoid-criticism-say-nothing-do-nothing-be-nothing) are always a fine choice. I also find [quotes](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/86495-a-wise-man-can-learn-more-from-a-foolish-question) by Bruce Lee to be quite inspiring.

Slowly and through life's many lessons, I also came up with my own quote. It is more of an observation and something I have noticed not only in my life but mostly in the life of others. The quote follows:
> *I might not know everything but I know one thing. Commitment is everything.*

Evidently, everything in life requires some level of commitment. How successful an attempt is at anything, depends heavily on the level of commitment. A goal that is harder to achieve, also requires the highest level of commitment. There's a famous quote that laid part of the foundation for my quote:
> *You can have anything in life if you will sacrifice everything else for it.*

We are defined by what we're willing to let go in order to focus our efforts on what matters the most. We are defined by our level of commitment. Commitment is everything.
