I mentioned in a previous post how much I like history and culture. I'm currently in a city which has an abundance of both; Rome. 

I have been to quite a few cities in Europe and abroad but it's safe to say that nothing compares to Rome when it comes to history.

Every area I've been so far has some historical significance. The architecture is outstanding. I did the tour of the colosseum and found out many interesting things like the origins of the name. It comes from a big statue that was outside the colosseum. It stood at 27meters high and thus was branded as colossal hence where the name of the colosseum came from.

Though the colosseum was amazing, the highlight of my time here was the Pantheon which is truly majestic. An incredible feat of architecture and creativity, it is the only dome in the world which is not reinforced and it still contains the original marble.

One thing is for sure in Rome though. The espresso is king...
