Today my student apprentice who I've been mentoring for the last three months, gave a presentation talking about all the lessons he learned during his apprenticeship.

"The sea is deep", he said.

It was something that everyone appreciated and nodded in agreement. It's what makes our job both frustrating and exciting. It can be frustrating because we humans naturally tend to focus on things that we miss rather than appreciate what we already have and in software one always misses many things. Equally though, we don't like being bored and it is this same aspect that makes the journey feel endless. This prevents us from getting bored.

Even though he can now start swimming in this deep sea, he understood that practice and experience are the things that help us swim deeper and further.
