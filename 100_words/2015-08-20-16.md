A common problem I face in my every day work is that of simple explanations. By that I mean the process by which I try to express my thoughts to the people around me. Einstein [famously said](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/alberteins383803.html) that if you can't explain something in simple terms then you simply don't understand it well enough.

Though knowledge is required it's certainly not the only ingredient. The ability to remain calm and composed, the experience that you accumulate over time, these are all things that contribute to this essential ability. Writing also helps since jotting down your thoughts allows you to see more clearly where they get convoluted and need clarifying.

The search for simplicity continues...
