Today for some reason I wasn't in the best of moods when I woke up. You know it's going to be one of those days when you really don't want to get out of the bed. In the past, I used to have those days frequently when I was doing things or work that I didn't enjoy much. Fortunately, I am now in a position where I love what I do and getting out of bed is not an issue.

Despite that, I didn't feel the world on my side this morning. Fast forward in the afternoon and I'm back to feeling great. What happened in between? People. More specifically, watching people finding satisfaction from doing something that they love and enjoy.

Programming offers many alleys through which one can find satisfaction and there's nothing better to showcase that than a [Coderetreat](http://coderetreat.org/about). We hosted a mini one (half-day) today at our office for people from one of our clients. Seeing how much value those people got by exploring the constraints imposed by each session, was truly fantastic.

The biggest lesson or reminder for me was how much value I get from seeing people finding purpose and meaning. Helping people along that journey makes me happy. It is a universal medicine that works every time.
