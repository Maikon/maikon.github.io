I love drinking coffee. I also enjoy making coffee. The process itself helps me relax and slow down in many ways. Pouring a good cup of coffee requires attention to detail and patience. The water and beans must be prepared in a certain way depending what your desired result is.

Though I do like changing my coffee every now and then, I still haven't found a coffee that satisfies my taste buds as much as [this Vietnamese](https://www.algcoffee.co.uk/index.php?route=product/product&filter_name=vietnam&product_id=2192) coffee does. If you are visiting London make sure to pass by that store and grab a bag; You will not regret it.
