In the dictionary the word "consultant" is defined as "_a person who provides expert advice professionally_". People turn to consultants when they need help with improving something. They pay money to get someone who has more knowledge on the subject they need help with. In our industry a consultant does one of two things. Offer advice on how the software can be improved or write code. In some cases that person will do both.

The resulting software can then be used as tool to measure the success of that engagement. Is that though the only valuable measurement of success for a software consultant? I think not.

The more I learn about our industry, the more I become aware of how many things need improving. Software is certainly one area where improvement is needed. I do think though that there are other areas where quality is often overlooked. Improving the culture of a company or the team I'm working with, is something that I will use in order to measure how successful I was at my job. If I managed to inspire someone to be better then I did my job well. If I improved a team in some form or shape then I did my job well.

Is the company or team I'm leaving behind better? Did my work have a lasting impact even after I left? These are the questions I will be asking myself at the end of and past a project.
