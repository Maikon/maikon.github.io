Goal reached. 100 posts over 100 days.

For 100 days straight (excluding weekends), I've been writing a blog post. To say that this has now become part of my daily life, would be an understatement. The amount of time that it takes to form a habit is [debatable](http://jamesclear.com/new-habit) but I think it's likely to be lower than 100 days.

The feelings are mixed.

On one hand I'm looking forward to taking a break from writing but on the other I feel like I will be missing an important part of myself if I do so. Even though some times the process wasn't easy, especially on days with no "inspiration", I really enjoyed it.

The biggest benefit from this journey is that now I don't have as much of an issue as I used to when it comes to start writing anything. I can sit down and get going..

Time for a good break now. One journey comes to an end but looking forward starting a similar one in the future.
