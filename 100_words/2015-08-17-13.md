The young man had a busy week as usual. He wrote code, he wrote emails and talked with people. A week similar to the ones that preceded it. The weekend was fast approaching and when it came it also brought with it it's own flavor of busyness; A house-warming party with plenty of preparation. This was a better form of busyness since at the very end of it, there was a relaxing party to be held. It was indeed, splendid.

On Sunday though the young man embraced the nothingness. He went to an Art gallery with his partner to observe Art and.. Nothingness. Wonderful.
