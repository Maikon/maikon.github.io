Quite thrilled for tonight. Thrilled because I will be finally watching Ant-Man which is another movie that forms part of the glamorous Marvel universe. Underwhelming as he may sound, Ant-Man is a fantastic character if not only for the fact that he can talk to insects through his unique mask. Amazingly, he can also shrink in size to the point that he is no longer visible to the naked eye. Creator of the fearsome Ultron, Ant-Man was also a founding member of the courageous Avengers squad. A devoted hero who also shared some romantic moments with Wasp, a fellow avenger, Ant-Man is an admirable character.
