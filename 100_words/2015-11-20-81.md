In a [recent post](http://makisotman.com/100_words_challenge/100/2015/11/11/73.html), I wrote about how throughout your career you should focus on your own abilities only and why that matters. The main idea is the fact that what motivates me to write software could be very different than what motivates someone else and that's very important.

Something which is equally important is context. Context is important in the sense that it helps us determine the tone of our conversations. When someone says "ah this is actually simple" when talking about a problem, they're really talking about context. Their context.

Something is _simple_ to me only because I have enough context in my mind that helps me see it as _simple_. I've encountered similar problems before therefore this problem that I'm facing seems _simple_. The person sitting next to me and that does not carry that context, fails to see why this is _simple_ and rightly so.

Simplicity is all about context.
