Software Craftsman. That's what my business card reads. This title evokes a variety of feelings and expressions by others. Some very few hear those words and think of elitism, many others see them as a noble and admirable cause. Treating your profession as a craft is indeed a noble cause.

Craftsmanship extends way beyond code and dedication to one's work is merely a part of this ideal.

Always trying to be on time. Consistently acting in a mature and professional manner. Cleaning your house diligently and deliberately. Even the simple act of washing dishes can be approached with the mindset of a craftsperson.

Improving yourself is not limited to just work. Craftsmanship therefore is a way of life.
