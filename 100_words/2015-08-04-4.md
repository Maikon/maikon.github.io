The tool selected was Karma. The Craftsman sat down with a clear mission in mind.
He whispered to himself, while hesitating and despite his fear, "a test suite for Javascript must exist".
The fear and cause for hesitation stemmed from the fact that the Craftsman had little to no experience
with this tool. The Craftsman heard also of the traps that plagued the Javascript land.

The Craftsman seeks to see the mission through, battle his fears and conquer the unknown
for beyond the unknown lies *Knowledge*, the Craftsman's most powerful tool, waiting to be sharpened.
The journey continues, now and beyond forever...
