Being a relaxed person, I often postpone or even worse, forget about things that could be crucial. A crucial or at least important part of our health, is dental hygiene. Foolishly enough, I neglected mine for quite some time now and that has come back to haunt me. Discipline was high when I used to live in Cyprus since my attendance at a dentist practice was satisfactory. Sadly as a result of my negligence, my upper right tooth has slowly decayed to the point where part of it was chipped off while I was eating a snack. The rather posh dentist who examined me today recommended immediate treatment. The more pleasant solution would be a root filling or in the worst case scenario the removal of the faulty tooth which is a dreadful thought. Positive thinking will suffice until the fateful treatment day.
