At 8th Light every Friday we work half of the day. The rest is given to us to work on anything that helps become better, whether that is doing open source work, writing a blog post, or working on a personal project, that time is yours.

The client which I'm currently working with also has this policy in place for their team which is great. Earlier in the week we agreed that today everyone would present something for five minutes. Pizza arrived on time and everyone gathered around the big screen. The cool thing was that we had people joining remotely. One person actually gave a very cool talk on how to make good Ramen _from_ Japan!

The variety of topics was very nice too. From food, to programming, to volunteering, to TR-808 music making and language learning techniques everyone had something interesting to share. It was a very rewarding experience and one which left everyone wanting for more. The team enjoyed it to the point that we will be doing it again in the near future.
