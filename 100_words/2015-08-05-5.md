I attended tonight an event I regularly attend called Codebar. Codebar helps people from underrepresented communities learn basic web and programming skills. Experienced developers pair up with students and they help them with a variety of topics. I enjoy attending Codebar. I find it to be an excellent way of giving back to the community and helping making it more diverse. The enthusiasm shows on a beginner's face when they learn something new and it's one of the most gratifying feelings for me personally. I couldn't have any Pizza tonight though since my stomach is still recovering from past food adventures. A salad suits my stomaches desire better.
