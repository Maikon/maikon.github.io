My partner was working with Google's adwords the other day whilst trying to generate more traffic for her dad's website.

At one point she was going through [the website](http://allcarsworkshop.co.uk/) and she asked me what I thought of it. I said it looked good albeit old. She then made a very good point that despite the fact that the website is old, it was still serving its purpose really well.

All the necessary information that someone needed was very visible. Phone numbers and email at the top. Any specific information like MOT and address details, clearly marked on the side. When clicked, they display the information needed without any extra noise.

Yet it _feels_ old.

I've seen many things that use shiny new technology yet they're nowhere near as usable and clear as the above site despite the fact that they _feel_ and look new.

This got me thinking.

Perhaps the fact that the people designing that website back then had less choices from the technology point of view, helped them. Having to worry less about what technology to use but rather on how to design a meaningful and usable website can help keep the focus on where it matters.

Perhaps...
