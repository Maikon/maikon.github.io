Recently I came across [this great talk](https://vimeo.com/43659070) by Dan North where I found out about a behavioural pattern called __"Create Urgency"__. This pattern can be understood better through the ["The Theory Of Constraints"](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheoryOfConstraints). The main goal of this theory is to find what, within a process, is the biggest constraint. Once found, efforts are then directed towards optimizing and improving that constraint in order to increase the throughput of the process.

Dan mentions the book ["The Goal"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0566086654?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=ox_sc_sfl_title_11&smid=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE) which describes the process. At the end of the book there's an interview with the author where when asked why this is such a difficult process to apply, he responded by saying that a paradigm shift is required.

To create a paradigm shift three things are required:

- Pressure (have a deadline)
- No other option (You've tried everything else)
- Information (knowledge)

This is where the __"Create Urgency"__ pattern emerges. Dan gives the example of a colleague of him who learned __Node.js__ by publicly committing to build a feature for the business they were in (pressure) in Node.js (no other option) by a given deadline (pressure). He put himself in a position where he had to deliver. By doing so he learned only what was necessary to get the job done and as a bonus he learned Node.js.

I think this is a very powerful technique. Constraints are often seen as obstacles but in reality constraints can benefit us in many great ways. It reminded me of this [other great talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/phil_hansen_embrace_the_shake) which I also highly recommend.
