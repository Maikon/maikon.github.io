I've been in the UK now for roughly seven years. Unsurprisingly, I got used to the weather. To the untrained eye, or rather untrained skin, the British weather seems horrible. I quite like it. Ironically, coming from an island one would assume that I would despise the rain and the cold but I find them quite refreshing. There is however a trait of the British weather that I I dislike and that is its dishonesty.

The sun is up and shining, luring you into this wonderful world where umbrellas do not even occupy a single brain cell. Suddenly everything is upside down and rain is hitting you hard. You're exposed and helpless. The weather is so dishonest that even the weather-lady is tricked into telling you that everything will be fine today. The app on your phone is propagating these lies further by only showing the *sunny* icons and declaring the day as 'good'. Nothing though gives you comfort while the rain keeps pounding you mercilessly.

Only one thought remains. "Umbrella. Always".
