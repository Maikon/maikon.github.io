Yesterday the Raspberry Pi Foundation [announced](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-zero/) _Raspberry Pi Zero_. A computer costing $5. Yes. Five. Dollars. The best part was that they released it on the same day with their [MagPi magazine](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/how-to-get-magpi-40/) which included one of these tiny computers. Needless to say none were left yesterday. A digital copy can be found for free [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi-issues/MagPi40.pdf).

Luckily enough today I managed to get the last copy from a local WHSmith and I'm ecstatic. I already have a few ideas of what I want to do with it but the magazine includes some cool projects that I can start with. I've always wanted to get into more "hardwar-y" stuff and Zero is provides the perfect and most minimal starting platform. The fact that is $5 dollars is still crazy but it shows how far we've come technologically when we can ship a computer with a printed magazine.

For now getting Erlang and Elixir on it is a good starting point to see what's possible. The "Mood Light" project from the magazine though would be a good first project.
