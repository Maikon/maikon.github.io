title: Default Breakfast

I tend to wake up fairly early every day despite the fact that I live quite close to my office. This is something that I started doing even when I did not have this new found luxury. The main motivation behind this early start, is to enjoy a nice breakfast without getting rushed.

Initially I would try and come up with a breakfast idea in the morning and that ended up not only consuming more time than necessary, it also activated [Ego depletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion). To minimize the mental damage, I resorted to a default breakfast. Egg omelette with spinach and baby tomatoes accompanied by a fine cup of freshly made coffee. The beauty of this is that I can create different variations of this breakfast whilst spending close to zero mental fuel. Broccoli instead of spinach. Throw in some feta cheese. Add cinnamon.

The result tastes great ninety percent of the time and that's good enough when you're looking for a quick breakfast without spending all your mental effort on it. The extra ten percent is simply too much to deal with in the morning and not worth the effort.
