Is how we say "coffee" in Greek. Since today it's the [International Coffee Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Coffee_Day), I thought I'd dedicate today's blog post to one of the favourite drinks, if not *the* favourite, of the world.

My relationship with coffee started very late compared to other people. In Cyprus we serve coffee in what's called the "turkish/arabic" style. Finely grounded beans are mixed with water inside a small, long handled pot called [Briki](https://www.google.com/search?q=cyprus+coffee+pot&safe=off&tbm=isch&imgil=a93zrsn9N6NnLM%253A%253BJcrue1KOBHWcSM%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.mystockphoto.com%25252Fphotograph%25252Fbriki-coffee-pot-jls-060-cyprus-briki-coffee-pots-greek-319474&source=iu&pf=m&fir=a93zrsn9N6NnLM%253A%252CJcrue1KOBHWcSM%252C_&biw=1440&bih=787&usg=__1o0cgtrRggeSFuLTK0_NGYE8sF8%3D&ved=0CCgQyjdqFQoTCLODtKj1ocgCFYGqgAodu8kJDw&ei=Sn0NVrO2KoHVggS7k6d4#imgrc=bGsW7G67_zbqCM%3A&usg=__1o0cgtrRggeSFuLTK0_NGYE8sF8%3D). Unlike many styles of coffee, this style provides a very strong kick to it and perhaps that's also what I didn't like about it in all my years back home.

My taste for coffee could also be something that came about with age. It's only in the last 4-5 years or so, that I started experimenting with different types of coffee and I have been enjoying it since. It has many properties that can act positively on one's health but as with anything, things can go wrong when abused.

I will leave you with a fascinating article I read a while back that showcases, to a certain extent, the influence coffee has on humanity. Sometimes it's a matter of [life and death](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/09/how-coffee-fueled-the-civil-war).
