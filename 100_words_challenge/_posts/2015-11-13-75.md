It's a tradition at 8th Light for apprentices to learn how to juggle. It has been shown that juggling can have a [positive impact](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091016114055.htm) on our mind and aside from that, we use it as an exercise to help get our mind away from a problem we might be stuck on so that we start fresh.

It is hard get going at the beginning but then again that's true for most things in life. What I did when I was learning, was to practice with one hand first and trying to juggle two balls. Once I became effective with that technique I then started using my other hand and increased the amount of balls.

I also [found](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1050222/concurrency-vs-parallelism-what-is-the-difference/13226948#13226948) that the above can be used as an analogy to explain _concurrency_ and _parallelism_. When practicing with one hand, I was juggling balls _concurrently_. This is to say that though I was using ___multiple balls___, I was holding/throwing only ___one ball at a time___. When I started using my other hand, the task became parallel since now I was catching/throwing ___multiple balls at the same time___.
