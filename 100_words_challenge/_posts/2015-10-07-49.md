I'm not a big series person. I don't watch Game of Thrones, nor did I watch Lost and generally don't care much about series. __Except__ for [_The Flash!_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3107288/)

There's not many things that get me as excited as screen adaptations of comic book heroes. This one, which started last year, is plain awesome. It follows the comics closely but with some interesting twists which make the show irresistible for people like me.

People find relaxation through different means. Reading a comic book or watching series based on them does the trick for me. With the rise of the Marvel cinematic universe, big studios have realised the endless potential(financially) that exists in making these shows. DC is fighting back with _The Flash_ and _Arrow_ and they're doing a pretty good job at that.

This is a battle that definitely benefits the aficionados of the kind. It is a battle I am enjoying. I'm off now to watch the first episode of the new season!
