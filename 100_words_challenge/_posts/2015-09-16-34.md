The finest football competition in Europe and arguably in the world, starts again today for the reigning champions and arguably the finest club team the world has seen, in my humble opinion, FC Barcelona. Barcelona won the competition last year in true style, cruising through the group stage and onto the knockout stages where it efficiently and with ease dispatched the likes of Manchester City and Paris Saint-German before serving revenge on a cold dish to Bayern Munich for the defeat it suffered at the hands of the Bavarians back in 2012, a game in which I was present, ultimately winning the final with an emphatic 3-1 against Juventus.

No team has ever won this prestigious competition since it's re-inception back in 1992 and it's time for that to change. Vamos Barca!
