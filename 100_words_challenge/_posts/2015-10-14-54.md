After work today, I attended [Codebar](https://codebar.io/), an event where people starting out with programming get paired with developers. One of it's goals is to help people that are trying to enter the industry and/or people that are just generally trying to understand better what programming is about.

I try as much as I can to attend this event and help out. One of the most common issues I face is that of language. By language I mean the language we use as programmers to communicate between us. It's such a strong language that when we try to explain things to someone that doesn't speak that language, we usually get blank stares. Part of the reason I think why this language is so strong within the industry is the fact that many people use these terms without fully understanding what they mean and thus perpetuating their existence.

When we don't understand something fully yet we use a term indiscriminately, we owe it to ourselves to stop and invest time into learning what that term actually means. By doing so we also help lower the barrier of entry for beginners and that's a good thing.
