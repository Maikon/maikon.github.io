Today we witnessed the *end* of a journey. Priya finished her student apprenticeship in style. She described quite beautifully her experience over the last four months and all the lessons she learned along the way. She displayed one of those lessons during the talk by being composed and calm throughout it.

We all felt quite happy to see her come through such a journey with all this knowledge and the desire to continue to grow. I still remember meeting her at [Codebar ](http://codebar.io/) for the first time and talking to her about our student apprenticeship which was merely a thought at the time in the London office. I felt quite happy and proud today seeing her racing past the "finish" line but as we all know here at 8th Light, there is no such thing as a finish line since our journey is ongoing...
