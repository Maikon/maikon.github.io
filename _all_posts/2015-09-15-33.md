title: Loudest Claim
category: 100

Words can be powerful and meaningful, full of wisdom and knowledge or they can be weak and petty, stripped of any meaning, empty and dark like the coldest of rooms. We express ourselves daily through words and speech, making claims, arguing for and against.

Speech is a tool we all yield to some extent for good or bad. It's a tool that we use often to make claims about ourselves or others, about our goals, our aspirations and inspirations, our fears and ignorance, our weaknesses and strengths. Claims come in all flavors, some are bold, some are weak, some are true yet others ever so false. There is however the loudest claim of them all. It is called Action and it carries with it the weight of a ton of words.
