I attended a nice conference over the weekend in Dublin which was on a subject I have a great interest in such as Functional programming and which was also appropriately themed with cats which is yet another thing I am fond of.*

While there and before the main conference on Saturday, I attended a sort of mini conference on Friday, which was part of the [Erlang Factory](http://www.erlang-factory.com/) series and it included a workshop with Joe Armstrong on the fascinating subject of Cryptography, something which gave me plenty food for thought and exploration.

It also consolidated my opinion on which languages and technologies I want to be focusing now and in the long term future and those are [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) and it's ancestor the great old [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/).


* The challenge of this week's writing challenge is to use long sentences. Surely you must appreciate my effort there.
