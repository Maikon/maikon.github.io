The Cypriot craved for his lost long favourite food, [Souvlaki](http://www.cyprus.com/souvlaki.html). Since moving to the UK, the Cypriot consumed mostly British food; Bangers and Mash and Salt Beef were both a staple choice.

Though he enjoyed British cuisine, he often felt that it was lacking in certain ways. Perhaps this feeling was amplified by his desire to taste native food yet again. He looked and searched for something that would satisfy that desire. He found [Paneri](https://www.zomato.com/london/paneri-palmers-green) and with it he also found joy. He had to travel long distances though for that but after a long search the Cypriot found another place of great promise. The Cypriot ate his Souvlaki and even for a bit, felt at home again.
