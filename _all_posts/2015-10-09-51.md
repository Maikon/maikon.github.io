A lot of what life is about is learning. Learning and improving. We learn from the first day that we're born. We learn to adapt to the feedback that we receive and adjust to the surrounding environment.

Receiving feedback and using it is a very useful and important skill. It is also something that over time and as we grow, deteriorates. It is similar to the curiosity we have as children. Somewhere along the path of life, both become less important somehow. Yet both are so important in our quest to become better.

Seeking feedback and trying to improve is one thing but before that is even possible, self-awareness must be practiced. You must become self-aware that there's something that you want to change. Something you want to become better at. Self-awareness is very important and it requires a very high level of honesty with yourself. Admitting where you fall short is the first step towards a better you.
