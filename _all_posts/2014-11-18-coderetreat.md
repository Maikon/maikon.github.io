title: "Global Coderetreat Day"
category: post

This past Saturday it was the [Global Day of
Coderetreat](http://gdcr.coderetreat.org/).
[Coderetreat](http://coderetreat.org/) is a day-long event focused on
practising the fundamentals of software development and design. The
day is split into four 40min sessions where participants pair-up and
work on [Conway's Game of
Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). What makes
the event so fun and rewarding however, are the constraints imposed on
each session.

The 4 constraints vary and are only limited by the imagination of those 
involved. The ones that were imposed during the day were the following:

- **No Primitives**
- **No return values**
- **TDD as if you meant it**
- **No talking**

In our day to day work we make decisions of all kinds. Some are big,
many if not most are small. Whenever a big problem needs to be solved, a
discussion ensues between the people that will work on it and once is
decided what the approach would be, the coding begins. Many of the
keystrokes that are happening during that phase are kind of automatic.
Every person has a certain set of guidelines that he/she uses to tackle
a specific problem. *"I have the concept of a Person so I need a class"*
is an example. The code produced will reflect and satisfy that
guideline.

It's hard to imagine not doing any of the four things above in our daily 
work and that's understandable. The purpose of a Coderetreat is not to
impose certain rules on the developer's workflow but rather show what insights
can be retrieved by exploring the extremes of code and communication. It
is often said that creativity lies in the most unusual places and those
are the places that one visits when attending a Coderetreat. It
reminds me of
[this](http://www.ted.com/talks/phil_hansen_embrace_the_shake) TED talk
and the power that comes with the ability to embrace limitations. It
also blends well with the philosophy of
[Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen).
