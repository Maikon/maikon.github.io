It's Friday. A rather warm morning in beautiful London. I'm up and preparing for my talk tonight. Even though I've given this talk before, I still feel a bit nervous. Like this challenge, I have a set of restrictions. 15 minutes. The audience on the other side of the screen and the world. It's an interesting set of restrictions because the message of my talk is about slowing down and listening. I, on the other hand must deliver this talk and its message in a rapid and concise manner. No room for slowing down. Like with anything in life, you must be able to change gears when necessary. Time to jump in the fast lane.
