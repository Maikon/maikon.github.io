It's that great time of the year. The tempo is building up. The excitement is rising as the time approaches. First big title of the season is on the horizon. We gloriously took all three that were on the plate last year and we did so with style.

Daring, unconditional, provocative. We have been criticized before. "Their style is dying" they said. "They need to change" they repeated over and over again. We proved them wrong. This is our own way, the way we know best. The goal is very clear. Adamant, confident, determined.

Get ready because it's showtime. Vamos!
