"Remember, with great power comes great responsibility" said Uncle Ben to Peter Parker in the old Spider Man movie. It is a quote that is used often and is indeed, very true.

Power comes in different flavours; status, perceived expertise, a higher position. Power can also be determined by how much you can influence and impact the life of others. The more people look up to you for advice and knowledge, the more power you posses. A teacher for example has a lot of power. She can influence the life of every single child in her classroom. She can inspire a child towards a direction or she can push that child away from that direction. My math teacher did the latter with me even though he meant well by believing he was doing the right thing.

[Self-awareness](http://makisotman.com/100_words_challenge/100/2015/10/09/50.html) becomes even more important when we try to assess what the impact of our actions could be. The important thing is that we do so constantly. Our actions matter. Someone will look up to us for inspiration and guidance. Whether its a family member, a friend, a colleague, it will happen. The responsibility is on us as individuals to realise the weight of our actions and act accordingly.
