It's finally here.

The new Star Wars movie is landing at 00:00 sharp and I will be there eagerly waiting for the screen to light up.

I'm obviously excited for the movie itself but I almost feel double the excitement because for months I have avoided any sort of trailer or piece of information that could reveal details about the movie.

This would not be the case though if I continued on the path of watching trailer after trailer of a movie until the movie itself was out. I remember years ago, a colleague of mine who had worked in the film industry, telling me how trailers were bad and that even actors themselves hated them. I simply dismissed his ideas and said how I thought they were great to build up excitement around a movie. Until...

Thor: The Dark World and Captain America: Winter Soldier.

When I went to watch the above films, there were two ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMU8EPM0xMQ), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqIBGEcKhGs)) scenes where the potential for suspense could be great but it wasn't. Why? Because I had [watched](https://youtu.be/npvJ9FTgZbM?t=2m10s) the [trailers](https://youtu.be/NLWsK1ZFunA?t=1m22s) and I knew what the outcome would be in both cases. At that moment I made the decision to not watch a trailer again _unless_ it's a movie I don't care about that much.

Tonight I am truly in for a surprise.
