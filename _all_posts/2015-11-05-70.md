A big part of what makes someone a craftperson is discipline. The discipline to strive towards becoming better and not sticking only to things you feel comfortable with. The discipline to get out of bed early so that you have some time to practice even when your natural instincts tell you to stay in bed.

This can be quite hard since most of the gains are not visible immediately. Waking up every morning to practice a kata that you're working on might not seem very beneficial during that moment. Where it will pay off is when you perform it in front of an audience or when you try to explain it in detail to someone else learning it.

I will end this post with a quote that I like on the subject which comes from the book ["How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Read-Book-Intelligent-Touchstone/dp/0671212095/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1446707998&sr=8-1&keywords=how+to+read+a+book) (Highly recommended):
