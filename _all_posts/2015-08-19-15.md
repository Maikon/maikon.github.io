title: Disciplined Hygiene Part Deux
category: 100

I mentioned on a [previous post](https://gist.github.com/Maikon/892950571dcb9d8c7c17#file-2015-08-07-7-md) how important it is to remain disciplined when it comes to things like dental hygiene. Well, today my opinion got reinforced. After the dentist finished examining the faulty tooth, he delivered the damning news. The tooth is beyond savior. He proposed a couple of solutions which are not that important in this story.

What is important however is rigorously applying that discipline when necessary. Postponing things relating to health, like my dental appointments, can be costly in many ways. I promise to myself then from now on, to never delay things that affect my health and can be done immediately.
