Investment is a heavily used word nowadays. If you work in any field that is somehow related to the tech industry, you will hear that word being thrown around a lot. "Startup 'X' got the investment they needed", "Angel investor 'Y' is backing them now" etc. Investment is seen as a tool, a means to an end and often, not always, is associated with money. People believe that with the right investment they can change the world in some way.

What makes a good investment is debatable and I'm certainly not an expert. However there is one thing I believe, which when given the right attention and care, turns into the best investment ever. Children. Children are the greatest investment for the future. They can shape and change the world tremendously in more ways than imaginable. They're beautifully honest and express their views in a way that we as adults often forget to do. Nurture a child lovingly and she/he will change the world in her/his own way.

Whenever you're faced with a decision on what to invest in, whether that's time, money or in general effort, think about The Greatest Investment. Think about children.
