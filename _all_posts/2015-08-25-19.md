I really like British weather. Before you frown your eyebrows further fellow reader, allow me to elaborate. First of all a disclaimer: I come from a [place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus) where the Sun is king and going to the beach is the norm. Yet I'm quite indifferent to that fact.

The main reason for my lack of enthusiasm is because every time I tried doing anything productive in that type of weather, I failed miserably. Though this might come as a surprise, [studies](http://blog.crew.co/how-climate-influences-productivity-why-the-future-of-productivity-doesnt-look-so-hot/) seem to back it up. I always feel much more productive when a rainy, cold day is on the horizon instead of the suspicious rays of the sun.

There are moments though where I do need the Sun with all the glory it brings and that's when I'm on holidays. That's also where I get to appreciate my home country the most.
