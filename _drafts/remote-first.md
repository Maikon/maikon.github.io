_"I want a job that I can take with me. I want to travel."_

This was my answer to people asking me why I'd want to learn how to code.
It had nothing to do with me loving code and everything to do with
flexibility. Flexibility to work on my own terms.

I ended up doing the exact opposite when I finished the [coding bootcamp]() I
was attending. I joined a [consultancy]() and for the next few years I really
enjoyed learning about quality code and good practices, surrounded by great
people.

Still, going remote was something I would think about often. Despite me
having some remote experiences during my time as a consultant–some clients are more
flexible than others–it didn't feel right. After a brief stint at a
startup, I started looking for remote opportunities. Not just any remote
though. It had to be *remote-first*. Fast-forward to 6 months ago to
when I accepted an offer to work for a *remote-first* company called
[RailEuropeUK (formerly known as Loco2)]().

Remote-first is even better than I thought. I'd argue that it's the most
productive environment for an engineer. I'd go a step further and say an
engineer of *any* level.
