For the past 6 months or so I've been working at a company called
[RailEuropeUK (formerly known as Loco2)](https://raileurope.co.uk/). A company with a *remote-first* culture.

I've always wanted to work in a remote company. But remote and remote-first
are two very different things. I'm not going to lie; remote-first is even
better than I thought. I'd argue that it's the most productive environment
for an engineer. I'd go a step further and say an engineer of *any* level.
I'll explain why.

### Stand-up that works

Due to my previous role as a consultant, I experienced several variations
of stand-ups. A couple of benefits that are often cited for doing a team
stand up are:

- Visibility: You know what other teammates are working on
- Teamwork: You can help or receive help on a given topic

The above rarely worked in practice. Most of the time the stand up ended
being too long with folks (including myself) sharing all kinds of
information (from implementation details to plans for the week etc). Not
only was I looking forward for it to finish, by the
end of it I had forgotten what everyone else had mentioned.

Enter text-based asynchronous stand ups via Slack.

At RailEuropeUK we have a dedicated slack channel for the engineering team
to have our stand up. The only requirement? You post at _some point_ during
the day. As an engineer you can choose when to post yours. Maybe you have
something pressing that needs to be dealt with first thing in the morning.
You can share your standup later on. A more important trait though of this
setup and something that I personally enjoy is the ability to catch up with
other peoples work at _my own time_.

On a personal level I found none of them to be as useful

### Documentation as first-class citizen

Good documentation is important. At a remote-first company this is even
more important. When I joined the company I was pointed at our wiki page
for developer onboarding. Everything was so well documented that I was up
and running quickly. That was just the start though.

In the first few days, every time I'd have a question about something, my
instinct was to post the question in our tech channel. The majority of the
time the response would be _"Great question! We have a wiki for this!"_.
These days, anytime I have a question, I instinctively check the wiki
first. Most of the time the answer to my question is documented somewhere
and I'm still amazed at how powerful this approach is. Great documentation
covers a number of things.

#### Communication guidelines

One of the first pieces of documentation I came across was around
communication. Not sure who to message about topic X? Not sure where to
share a specific piece of information? These are questions that naturally
come up when you're dealing with multiple tools (we use Slack, Trello,
Basecamp amongst other things).

How
should I choose between private messages, public channels, threads and
basecamp?

Should you share something in privateAll
of these

#### Specific domain knowledge

As a new engineer on the team this is extremely helpful. Our system has
various levels of complexity. From provider integration (we have a few)
integrates with a number of different providers that are all different.

(i.e how a specific part of the system works)
someone who worked on a specific part of the code

#### Playbooks
(what to do when checkout error X happens)
on-call


I'm more enthusiastic than ever these days when I talk about the importance
of good documentation to friends that are engineers.

However there's an additional side-benefit that you get when you strive for
good documentation: improved communication.

Over-communication makes you a better developer, practicing your writing and
expressing thoughts in a consise and clear manner.

### Inclusive culture encouraging questions

- Pairing can be done remotely
-

### Remote vs Remote-first

- build from the ground up
- bolted on and not everyone is equally invested it it
