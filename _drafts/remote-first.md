For the past 6 months or so I've been working at a company called
[RailEuropeUK (formerly known as Loco2)](https://raileurope.co.uk/). A company with a *remote-first* culture.

I've always wanted to work in a remote company. But remote and remote-first
are two very different things. I'm not going to lie; remote-first is even
better than I thought. I'd argue that it's the most productive environment
for an engineer. I'd go a step further and say an engineer of *any* level.
I'll explain why.

### Documentation as first-class citizen

Good documentation is important. At a remote-first company this is even
more important. When I joined the company I was pointed at our wiki page
for developer onboarding. Everything was so well documented that I was up
and running quickly. That was just the start though.

In the first few days, every time I'd have a question about something, my
instinct was to post the question in our tech channel. The majority of the
time the response would be _"Great question! We have a wiki for this!"_.
These days, anytime I have a question, I instinctively check the wiki
first. Most of the time the answer to my question is documented somewhere
and I'm still amazed at how powerful this approach is.

Great documentation however covers a number of things.

#### Specific domain knowledge

(i.e how a specific part of the system works)
someone who worked on a specific part of the code

#### On-call playbooks
(what to do when checkout error X happens)

#### Communication guidelines
(i.e when to tag someone on slack)


I'm more enthusiastic than ever these days when I talk about the importance
of good documentation to friends that are engineers.

### Stand-up that works
     - Process, playbooks etc all defined
     - Async standup
     - etc

### Inclusive culture encouraging questions

- Pairing can be done remotely

### Remote vs Remote-first

- build from the ground up
- bolted on and not everyone is equally invested it it
