**TL;DR**

- Asynchronous standups FTW
  - catch up with others when it best suits you
  - easy to search and find things
  - use slack threads to discuss specific points from an update
- Document everything
  - communication guidelines
  - domain knowledge (i.e system design, tech stack, tool usage etc)
  - playbooks (i.e how to tackle issue X, how to respond to Y)
- Encourage over-communication
  - enables a culture of sharing
  - people feel more comfortable asking questions

---------------------------------------

For the past 6 months or so I've been working at a company called
[RailEuropeUK (formerly known as Loco2)](https://raileurope.co.uk/). A company with a *remote-first* culture.

I've always wanted to work in a remote company. But remote and remote-first
are two very different things. I'm not going to lie; remote-first is even
better than I thought. I'd argue that it's the most productive environment
for an engineer. I'd go a step further and say an engineer of *any* level.
I'll explain why.

### Stand-up that works

Due to my previous role as a consultant, I experienced several variations
of stand-ups. A couple of benefits that are often cited for doing a team
stand up are:

- Visibility: You know what other teammates are working on
- Teamwork: Based on the above, you can help or receive help on a given topic

This rarely worked in practice. Most of the time the stand up ended
being too long with folks (including myself) sharing all kinds of
information (from implementation details to plans for the week etc). Not
only was I looking forward for it to finish, by the
end of it I had forgotten what everyone else had mentioned.

Enter text-based asynchronous stand-up via Slack.

At RailEuropeUK we have a dedicated slack channel for the engineering team
to have our stand-up. The only requirement? You share yours at _some point_
during the day. This has several benefits.

#### Participate at your own pace

As an engineer you can choose when to post your update. Maybe you have
something pressing that needs to be dealt with first thing in the morning.
In that case you can share your stand-up later in the day and that's perfectly fine.

The more important benefit of this approach comes when you're consuming the
information. I can catch up with the updates from my colleagues _whenever
it suits my schedule_. Similar to sharing, I get to decide at which point
of the day I want to take a look at all the updates.

#### Help that matters

Going back to receiving or giving help on a specific topic, Slack offers a
great tool to engage with a colleague's update: threads.

Threads are a great tool because they visually don't add noise to the
channel whilst allowing folks to engage in a discussion on a specific
topic. This is the first time I've seen the often mentioned "help" benefit
of a stand-up being utilised effectively.

#### Retrievable information

The other benefit of this approach is that I can easily search through
Slack's history and find the information I need from a given update. This
is *very valuable*. I found myself doing this a number of times and this can
lead to things like creating or updating documentation with information
taken from a discussion.


### Documentation as first-class citizen

Good documentation is important. At a remote-first company this is even
more important. When I joined the company I was pointed at our wiki page
for developer onboarding. Everything was so well documented that I was up
and running quickly. That was just the start though.

In the first few days, every time I'd have a question about something, my
instinct was to post the question in our tech channel. The majority of the
time the response would be _"Great question! We have a wiki for this!"_.
These days, anytime I have a question, I instinctively check the wiki
first. Most of the time the answer to my question is documented somewhere
and I'm still amazed at how powerful this approach is. Great documentation
covers a number of things.

#### Communication guidelines

One of the first pieces of documentation I came across was around
communication. Not sure who to message about topic X? Not sure where to
share a specific piece of information? These are questions that naturally
come up when you're dealing with multiple tools (we use Slack, Trello,
Basecamp amongst other things).

How
should I choose between private messages, public channels, threads and
basecamp?

Should you share something in privateAll
of these

#### Specific domain knowledge

As a new engineer on the team this is extremely helpful. Our system has
various levels of complexity. From provider integration (we have a few)
integrates with a number of different providers that are all different.

(i.e how a specific part of the system works)
someone who worked on a specific part of the code

#### Playbooks
(what to do when checkout error X happens)
on-call


I'm more enthusiastic than ever these days when I talk about the importance
of good documentation to friends that are engineers.

However there's an additional side-benefit that you get when you strive for
good documentation: improved communication.

Over-communication makes you a better developer, practicing your writing and
expressing thoughts in a consise and clear manner.

### Over-communicate. All the time.
